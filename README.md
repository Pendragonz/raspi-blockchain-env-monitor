# raspi-blockchain-env-monitor

This repo is a compilation of the code written as part of my Individual Project for my final year at university.

Throughout this project I aim to produce an application which will run on the raspberry pi. It will record temperature
and humidity data through the use of a DHT22 temperature sensor and publish this information to the Stellar blockchain.

I also aim to create an API which will be used to interact with this program.
